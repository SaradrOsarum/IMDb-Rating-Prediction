# IMDb-Rating-Prediction
This model predicts IMDb movie ratings using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Gradient Boosting techniques. The dataset includes various features such as duration, age limt, rating of movies, metascore, discription, movie name and release year. SVR is employed to capture nonlinear relationships between features and ratings.

To determine which model performs closer to actual ratings, the model employs rigorous evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score. These metrics help in quantifying prediction accuracy and understanding how well each model generalizes to unseen data.
